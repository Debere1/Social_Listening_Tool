As always, there will be pain points as humans make adjustments and some reskill themselves in recognition of the game's new rules. But the overarching theme here is more of ""opportunity"" than ""challenge."" We believe that as repetitive and tedious tasks get automated through AI, more humans will be freed to do what we are uniquely good at: being creative.
